MitoSkel: Advanced Tool for Mitochondrial Morphology Analysis
MitoSkel is AI tool designed for automatic segmentation and quantification of mitochondria in fluorescence microscopy images. At the heart of MitoSkel is GAU-Net, a custom U-Net architecture enhanced with a trainable Gabor filter layer and a Thresholding Attention Mechanism (TAM). Trained on a diverse dataset of microscopy images, GAU-Net performs precise pixel-level segmentation, accommodating various mitochondrial shapes, sizes, and densities.

Key features include:

Advanced Segmentation: High accuracy in detecting complex mitochondrial structures.
Skeletonization and Quantification: Extracts morphological features, including length, branching points, and connectivity.
Versatility: Tested on diverse cell lines and imaging methods.
MitoSkel outperforms existing methods in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making it an invaluable resource for studying mitochondrial dynamics, function, and related pathologies.
